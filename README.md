# The Modelix Project

The modelix project develops an open source platform for (meta-)models on the web. We are native to the web and the cloud.

For general information on modelix, please refer to the [official modelix homepage](https://modelix.org) as well as the [platform documentation](https://docs.modelix.org).

For individual component specific documentation, see https://docs.modelix.org/modelix/latest/reference/components.html


# `modelix.mps-build-tools`

This repository contains `mps-build-tools` which can be used as a replacement for the MPS build language.
These components are used internally by modelix but can also be applied externally.
